Use sources for Dragon-32/64.

Put PI-COCO.ASC and PI-COCO.BIN on a disk image, then run PI-COCO.ASC

It is possible to run the demo under XROAR emulator directly.  Just make the next steps:
1. Run PI-COCO.ASC using Menu
2. Wait until an error message appears
3. Load file PI-COCO.BIN using Menu
4. RUN (use F12 or Shift-F12 to use the full throttle)

The screen will always be on if we run the program on the CoCo 3.
