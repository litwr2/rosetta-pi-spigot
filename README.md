# rosetta-pi-spigot
it contains implementations of pi-spigot algorithm for different assembly languages

Every program is satisfying four restrictions: 1) it calculates time; 2) it uses an OS function to print digits; 3) it uses less than 64 KB RAM for the code and data; 4) it utilizes all available RAM below 64 KB limit to get the maximum number of calculated digits, so it is forbidden to restrict artificially the maximum number of digits.

The presented programs claim to be the fastest pi-spigot algorithm implementations for 6502, 65816, z80, R800, 6809, 6309, pdp-11 eis, pdp-11 noeis, vax-11, 32016, arm1, arm2, arm250, 68000, 68010, 68020, 8088, 8086, 80186, 80286, 80386.
