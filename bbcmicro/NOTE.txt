*** 6502 ***

CH."PIC"  -- uses code for the CMOS 6502
CH."PIN"  -- uses code for the NMOS 6502
CH."PI"   -- uses code that works on the both
CH."PICP"  -- uses code for the 2nd co-pro to get more digits, this code is slightly less optimized

Use video mode 7 to get maximum number of digits.
Use *SHADOW to get even more digits - this requires additional memory for your system.
All these options are automatically set during the normal boot process.

Cleaning the screen can also slightly improve the results.  Use CLR or Ctrl-L for this.

There is a way to get the maximum number of digits with disabling the disc driver - video mode 7 is assumed - try this if PAGE is greater than &E00.
